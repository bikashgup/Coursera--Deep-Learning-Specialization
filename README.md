# Coursera--Deep-Learning-Specialization

The Deep Learning Specilaization course is divided into five separate courses. These courses helps you develop the better understanding of the deep learning knowledge. Here. the names of each courses along with assignments link are listed below. Please don't copy the notebooks code but use it as last resort if nothing comes upon your mind after many times of try.
